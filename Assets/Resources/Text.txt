Leopard
Africa, Arabia, India, east and southeast Asia
In Africa, they are found in woodlands, grasslands, forests, mountains, coastal scrub, swamps and deserts. Meanwhile, they are confined to remote foothills, forests and grasslands in Asia. 
Don't approach too closely especially if you see cubs, either alone or with their mother. Keep small children secure at night when camping in areas frequented by leopards. If a leopard charges, shout, clap your hands and wave your arms to appear bigger.
Leopards are found across much of Africa, Arabia, India, east and southeast Asia. In Africa, they are found in woodlands, grasslands, forests, mountains, coastal scrub, swamps and deserts. Meanwhile, they are confined to remote foothills, forests and grasslands in Asia. They consume a wide range of prey such as primates, livestock, wild sheep, pigs, goats, pangolins and other big cats such as cheetahs and African wild cats. They are excellent climbers and will often stash large carcasses in trees. They are active during the night. Don't approach too closely especially if you see cubs, either alone or with their mother. Keep small children secure at night when camping in areas frequented by leopards. If a leopard charges, shout, clap your hands and wave your arms to appear bigger.
Cheetah
southern and eastern Africa while a small population persists in Iran
found in both arid and semi-arid habitats and are able to endure wide extremes in temperatures (0 - 45ºC). 
If a curious cheetah approaches your safari vehicle, keep your arms and legs in the vehicle at all times. Slowly move the vehicle away from the animal. If the cheetah climbs onto your vehicle and reaches out to touch you or your camera, stay completely still.
Cheetahs are widespread in southern and eastern Africa while a small population persists in Iran. They are found in both arid and semi-arid habitats and are able to endure wide extremes in temperatures (0 - 45ºC). They chase prey with an average speed of 64 km/h and have a top speed of 112 km/h, lasting only about 20 seconds. They usually feed on gazelles, impalas and wildebeests. If a curious cheetah approaches your safari vehicle, keep your arms and legs in the vehicle at all times. Slowly move the vehicle away from the animal. If the cheetah climbs onto your vehicle and reaches out to touch you or your camera, stay completely still.
Tiger
Indian sub-continent, Indochina, Malaysia, Island of Sumatra, Eastern Russia, China and Korea 
They live in a wide range of areas, from tropical rainforests to temperature conifer-deciduous forests. 
When encountering a tiger, under no circumstance should you ever turn your back and attempt to run away. Making a loud noise by shouting or screaming and making yourself appear as big as possible may help to scare the tiger away. Avoid bending or squatting to pick things up if possible, as this may trigger an attack.
