## Description
Welcome to our project! This AR application with advanced image recognition capabilities is designed to provide users with informative and advisory content about the wildlife they encounter during walks in nature reserves or parks. With this app, users can point their phone camera at an animal they come across, and the app will automatically detect the animal and display a screen with relevant information and advice on how to interact with it safely. 
## Features
### Augmented Reality and Image Recognition
- Real-time Animal Detection: Utilizing a Tensor Flow Lite model we have trained ourselves, our app can identify 80 different animal species that users might encounter in nature reserves and parks.
- Informative Overlays: Once an animal is detected, the app displays an overlay with detailed information about the animal, including its habitat, behavior, and safety advice.
- User-Friendly Interface: The app is designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring that users of all ages can easily navigate and use its features.
### Advisory Information
- Safety Guideline: Each detected animal comes with a set of safety guidelines, helping users understand the best practices for interacting with the animal or avoiding potential dangers.
- Educational Content: Users can learn more about the ecology, conservation status, and interesting facts about each animal, enhancing their nature walk experience.
## Future Plans
- Plant Recognition: We plan to expand our app's capabilities to include **plant recognition**, providing users with information about various flora they encounter during their walks.
- Additional Species: Our team is continuously working to increase the number of recognizable animal species, aiming to provide a **comprehensive nature guide**.
